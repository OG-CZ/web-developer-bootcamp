    <h1>Wolf</h1>
    <p>
      The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the grey wolf or
      gray wolf, is a canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than
      thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog
      and dingo, though grey wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise
      naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest wild extant
      member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other
      Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter
      torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to
      smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to
      produce fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled
      white, brown, grey, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region
      may be nearly all white.
