      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the
      red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), originally native to Southeast Asia. It
      was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and has become one of the
      most common and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are
      primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also kept as
      pets.[1]

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Chickens</b> are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is
      round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are
      short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are
      too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and
      coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched chicks of both
      modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern
      varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh
      1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of
      the same age.[22]
