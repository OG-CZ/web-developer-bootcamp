  <p>
    C<sup>[c]</sup> is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in
    the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely used and influential. By
    design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of
    the typical CPU architecture; customized for the target instruction set. It
    has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially
    kernels[10]), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in
    application software has been decreasing.[11] C is used on computers that
    range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
    embedded systems.

    A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at
    Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on
    Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating
    system.[12] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.

    It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[13][14]
    with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures
    and operating systems. The book <i>The C Programming Language</i>,
    co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the
    de facto standard for the language.[15][1] C has been standardized since
    1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently,
    jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
    International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
