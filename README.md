### The Web Developer Bootcamp Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This is my complete code and project journey while going through **Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp** on Udemy.

#### About This Repo

This repository contains **hands-on code**, **exercises**, and **projects** I’ve written while progressing through the bootcamp. It covers everything from HTML & CSS basics all the way to deploying full-stack applications.

All code here is written and practiced as part of my personal learning journey. I regularly commit as I complete each section of the course.


#### What I’m Learning

##### Frontend Development

- Semantic HTML5 & Accessibility
- CSS3 Styling: Box Model, Flexbox, Grid
- Responsive Design & Media Queries
- Bootstrap for UI Components

##### JavaScript (Core to Advanced)

- JS Syntax: Variables, Conditionals, Loops
- Functions, Arrays, Objects
- DOM Manipulation & Events
- Advanced JS: Closures, `this`, `map()`, `reduce()`, etc.
- Async JS: Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`
- Fetch API & JSON

##### Developer Tools & Workflow

- Git & GitHub Workflow
- VS Code Tips
- DevTools & Debugging
- npm, Node modules, Environment Setup

##### Backend Development

- Node.js & Core Modules
- Express.js: Routing, Middleware, Views
- RESTful API Design
- Working with Forms & POST Requests

##### Databases

- MongoDB (local & Atlas cloud)
- Mongoose: Models, Validation, Queries
- CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

##### Authentication & Security

- User Authentication with Passport.js
- Sessions & Cookies
- Password Hashing (bcrypt)
- Flash Messages
- Authorization & Access Control

##### Templating & Views

- EJS Templating
- Layouts, Partials, Dynamic Rendering

##### Deployment

- Hosting with Heroku / Render
- Environment Variables & `.env`
- Preparing for Production

##### Bonus Topics

- Image Uploads (Cloudinary & Multer)
- API Integration (e.g., Mapbox)
- MVC Refactoring
- Advanced Error Handling in Express
