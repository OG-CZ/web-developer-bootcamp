# The Web Developer Bootcamp Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This is my complete code and project journey while going through **Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp** on Udemy.

---

## About This Repo

This repository contains **hands-on code**, **exercises**, and **projects** I’ve written while progressing through the bootcamp. It covers everything from HTML & CSS basics all the way to deploying full-stack applications.

All code here is written and practiced as part of my personal learning journey. I regularly commit as I complete each section of the course.
